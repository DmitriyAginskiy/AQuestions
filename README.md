# AQuestions
# Project description
The AQuestions allows users to ask a question or find an answer to their questions that have already been asked by other users. A user asks a question about a specific topic, and other users answer that question. There is also an opportunity to evaluate users ' questions and answers. To interact with the app, the user must register, otherwise they will only be able to view questions, but not the answers to them, and will not be able to ask a question or answer questions from other users.
